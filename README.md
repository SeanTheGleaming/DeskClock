# DeskClock
A simple desk clock designed for my school


This was originally a personal project, made open source on realising how customizable it was

To build, open cmd in the directory of the source code and type the following:

pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole main.py

Made by Sean A. Robinson
Enjoy!
